= Fedora Static Analysis Special Interest Group (SIG) =

(Note that this SIG is merely tentative for now)

== Goal and Scope ==
TBD

dmalcolm is interested in making it easy to run static code analysis tools on all of Fedora, and having a sane system for getting useful information from the firehose of data that doing so is likely to generate.  See http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2012-December/175232.html

See also the [[FormalMethods|Formal Methods SIG]] with which there's clearly an overlap.

== Mission and Plan ==
TBD

== Tasks ==
TODO

=== Static Code Analysis tools already in Fedora ===
TODO
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ gcc] - arguably we should pay more attention to the compiler warnings that gcc already generates: sometimes it's correctly pointing out a bug.
* [http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/ clang static analyzer] (in Fedora as "clang-analyzer" subpackage of "llvm")
* [https://gcc-python-plugin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cpychecker.html cpychecker] (part of gcc-python-plugin)
* [http://www.dwheeler.com/flawfinder/ flawfinder] (that page has a great list of links to other static analysis tools)
* [http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/ cppcheck] Cppcheck is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code.
* [https://sparse.wiki.kernel.org/ sparse] - a Semantic Parser for C, primarily used by kernel developers.

=== Package Want List ===
